# Operit2 Web Access

This directory owns the Web Access frontend boundary.

The deployment server must send these headers for every application asset so
threaded Sherpa ONNX WebAssembly can run local STT and TTS:

```text
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin
```

The deployment server or reverse proxy for `web.operit.app` must emit these headers. The Link Access server exposed by the CLI does not serve the Web frontend.

## Flutter Web development

The FVM-pinned Flutter SDK natively reads `web_dev_config.yaml` from the
Flutter app root. It configures the built-in development server at
`http://127.0.0.1:4835` and sends the three cross-origin isolation headers above.
No separate Node process or proxy port is required.

Run from `apps/flutter/app`:

```powershell
fvm flutter run -d edge
```

For Chrome, use `fvm flutter run -d chrome`. To open a browser manually, use
`fvm flutter run -d web-server` and open `http://127.0.0.1:4835`.
These devices share the same native server configuration; Flutter's debug
connection and hot reload use that origin directly.

For VS Code, select `Operit2: Web (isolated)` from Run and Debug and press F5.
It launches Edge through the FVM Flutter SDK without a pre-launch proxy task.

These headers enable cross-origin isolation, not unrestricted CORS access to
remote APIs. Remote API servers must still authorize the development origin
through their own CORS policies. `web_dev_config.yaml` only configures Flutter's
development server; deployed hosting must send the headers independently.

## Runtime layout

This is the standard Flutter Web entry directory for `web.operit.app`. The
standalone browser runtime is kept under `runtime/` and is split by purpose:

- `runtime/src/` contains TypeScript sources and its compiler configuration.
- `runtime/generated/` contains generated JavaScript/WASM artifacts and the v86
  guest runtime.
- `runtime/vendor/` contains third-party static files such as MessagePack.

Native apps and the CLI do not package or serve this directory. The settings
entry and `operit2 cli web open` open `https://web.operit.app/` without starting a
local server or putting credentials in the URL. Connecting to another device is
a separate node listening/pairing operation, not a Web Access server lifecycle.
